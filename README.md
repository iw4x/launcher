### ü™ü Windows
1. Download the game from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/).
2. Download the appropriate version of the IW4x launcher:
   - **Windows 64-bit**: Download the [latest iw4x-launcher.exe](https://github.com/iw4x/launcher/releases/latest/download/iw4x-launcher.exe).
   - **Windows 32-bit**: Download the [latest iw4x-launcher-x86.exe](https://github.com/iw4x/launcher/releases/latest/download/iw4x-launcher-x86.exe).
3. Place the `iw4x-launcher.exe` in the game directory.
4. Run `iw4x-launcher.exe`. After updating, the game will launch automatically.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### Information for server owners:
> On Windows, the launcher self-updates and restarts by spawning a new console.
> For automated processes, use `--skip-launcher-update` and manually download the latest launcher from [here](https://github.com/iw4x/launcher/releases/latest/download/iw4x-launcher.exe).

### üêß Linux

1. Download the game from Steam using either [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) or the official Steam desktop app.
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/iw4x/launcher/releases/latest) corresponding to your system architecture.
    - Most likely you want [iw4x-launcher-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/iw4x/launcher/releases/latest/download/iw4x-launcher-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz)
3. Unpack the archive and copy the `iw4x-launcher` executable to your game directory.
    - Alternatively, you can place it in your `PATH` so you can run it from anywhere. For example, in `/usr/local/bin/`
4. Make the launcher executable: `chmod +x iw4x-launcher`
5. Run the launcher from your game directory to download the client files: `./iw4x-launcher`

> [!TIP]
> Use the `--update` command-line argument if you want to launch the game through Proton or other Wine versions instead of the default wine found in your path.
